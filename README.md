# Genetic-Algorithms
This python based genetic algorithms project explores optimization by simulating natural selection processes. It evolves solutions iteratively through crossover, mutation, and selection to find optimal or near-optimal results for complex problems.

A few basic applications could be: Recurrent Neural Network, Mutation testing, Learning fuzzy rule base etc
